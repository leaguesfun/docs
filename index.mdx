## **What is Leagues.fun?**

Leagues.fun is a **multi-sport fantasy trading \+ tournament platform** that begins with the American football season. It's like traditional fantasy sports but with a twist: you acquire **Player Shares** (digital tokens representing athletes), use them to build lineups, and compete in contests to earn rewards.

### **Key Features**

* **Player Shares:** These are like owning stock in players. You buy, trade, or earn them, and they give you a piece of the rewards based on how the player performs.  
* **Contests:** Two types—paid (for real rewards) and free (for in-game points).  
* **Rewards Systems:**  
  * **Paid Contests:** Pay an entry fee, compete, and the top 20% win real prizes from the pooled fees (100% of the pool is distributed—no house cut).  
  * **Free Contests:** No entry fee, but you earn **Skill Points (SP)**, a soft currency used to redeem more Player Shares or packs.  
* **League XP (LXP):** A bonus progression system. Earn LXP by playing, winning, and spending—it keeps you engaged long-term and ties into a future **$LEAGUE token airdrop**.

Leagues.fun is skill-based, meaning your success depends on smart lineup choices and player performance in real games. No gambling here, it's all about strategy\!
