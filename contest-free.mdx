League Showdowns are our free weekly contests, perfect for beginners or casual players. No entry fee, but you can earn Skill Points (SP) to redeem for packs and more Player Shares.

* **Schedule:** Weekly on Sundays.  
* **Prize Pool:** 100,000 Skill Points (SP) per week (this is an example baseline; it may adjust based on platform growth).  
* **How Rewards Are Distributed:**  
  * First, the pool is split by player positions (based on Positions):  
    * QB: 20% (20,000 SP)  
    * RB: 30% (30,000 SP)  
    * WR: 30% (30,000 SP)  
    * TE: 10% (10,000 SP)  
    * D/ST: 10% (10,000 SP)  
  * Then, within each position's pool, rewards go to the top 10 performing players (based on real game stats that week).  
  * **Top 10 Weight Table:** Rewards are weighted like this (higher for top finishers):

| Position | Weight Percentage |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1st | 23% |
| 2nd | 16% |
| 3rd | 13% |
| 4th | 11% |
| 5th | 9% |
| 6th | 8% |
| 7th | 7% |
| 8th | 6% |
| 9th | 4% |
| 10th | 3% |

* **Example Calculation (QB Pool: 20,000 SP):**  
  * 1st QB: 23% → 4,600 SP  
  * 2nd QB: 16% → 3,200 SP  
  * 3rd QB: 13% → 2,600 SP  
  * 4th QB: 11% → 2,200 SP  
  * 5th QB: 9% → 1,800 SP  
  * 6th QB: 8% → 1,600 SP  
  * 7th QB: 7% → 1,400 SP  
  * 8th QB: 6% → 1,200 SP  
  * 9th QB: 4% → 800 SP  
  * 10th QB: 3% → 600 SP  
  * Total: Adds up to 20,000 SP.  
* **Shareholder Distribution:**  
  * Rewards for a player (e.g., 1st QB's 4,600 SP) are split among all owners based on shares owned and if they played a player for that tournament.  
  * Example: If Patrick Mahomes (1st QB) has 100,000 shares owned across users:  
    * Pool for Mahomes: 4,600 SP  
    * Per share: 4,600 ÷ 100,000 \= 0.046 SP  
    * If you own 1,000 shares: You earn 46 SP.  
* **What to Do with SP:** Use Skill Points to open exclusive SP packs, which contain new Player Shares to grow your portfolio.

Free contests are a great way to practice, earn SP, and build toward paid tournaments without risking anything.
