* **Schedule:** Weekly on Sundays (plus shorter Showdowns on Thursdays/Mondays).  
* **Entry:** Pay a fee (e.g., in Credits/USDC). You can enter up to 3 lineups, but each costs an extra fee.  
* **Prize Pool Example:** $100,000 (this is an example; actual pools depend on entries).  
* **Payout Structure:** Top 20% get rewarded  
  * **Tier 1: Top Finishers**  
    * 1st place: 15% → $15,000  
    * 2nd place: 7.5% → $7,500  
    * 3rd place: 4% → $4,000  
    * 4th place: 3% → $3,000  
    * 5th place: 2.5% → $2,500  
  * **Tier 2: High Performers**  
    * 6th–10th place: 1.5% each → $1,500 each  
    * 11th–20th place: 1% each → $1,000 each  
    * 21st–50th place: 0.5% each → $500 each  
  * **Tier 3: Solid Finishers**  
    * 51st–100th place: 0.25% each → $250 each  
    * 101st–250th place: 0.15% each → $150 each  
    * 251st–500th place: 0.1% each → $100 each  
  * **Tier 4: Min-Cash Line (Remaining Top 20%)**  
    * 501st–1,000th place: 0.05% each → $50 each  
* **Tie Handling:** If players tie for a position, prizes for those spots are combined and split evenly.  
  * Example: Tie for 1st → $15,000 \+ $7,500 \= $22,500 ÷ 2 \= $11,250 each.  
  * Tie for 10th → Prizes for 10th, 11th, and 12th pooled and shared.  
  * Tie at min-cash → Final payouts pooled and shared.  
* **Key Principles:**  
  * **Top Heavy:** About 32% of the pool goes to the top 10 for big wins.  
  * **Middle Tier:** 25% spread across strong finishers (top 50–500).  
  * **Min Cash:** The bottom of the top 20% gets a small payout

Premier Tournaments also pay out SP (like free contests), so you get double rewards\!
