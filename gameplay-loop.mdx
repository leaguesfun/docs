title: 'Core Gameplay Loop'
---
The gameplay is simple and loops like this: Acquire players → Build lineups → Compete → Earn rewards → Progress and repeat. Here's how it works step by step.

1. **Acquire Players**  
   * Buy packs using Credits or USDC (stable cryptocurrency).  
   * Earn Skill Points (SP) from free contests and redeem them for packs (which contain new Player Shares).  
   * Trade shares on the **Transfers Market** (an automated system using a bonding curve for fair pricing).  
2. **Build Lineups**  
   * Select a roster for a tournament: 1 QB, 2 RBs, 3 WRs, 1 TE, and 1 D/ST (Defense/Special Teams).  
   * You can enter up to 3 lineups per Premier Tournament (paid), but each extra lineup costs another entry fee.  
   * Important rule: Each player (per position) can only be used in **one contest at a time and one lineup at a time**. For example, if you use Patrick Mahomes in a paid tournament, you can't use him in a free one that week nor can you use him in multiple lineups in the same paid tournament.  
3. **Compete in Tournaments**  
   * **Premier Tournaments (Sundays):** Paid entry, real-money prizes for top 20%, plus SP rewards.  
   * **League Showdowns (Sundays):** Free entry, pays only SP.  
   * **Showdowns (Thursdays/Mondays):** Shorter, one-game tournaments for quick fun.  
4. **Earn Rewards**  
   * In paid contests: Win credits or real-value prizes from the entry fee pool.  
   * In free contests: Earn SP only.  
   * Key: Rewards are only for players you actually play in a tournament. If a player sits on your bench (not entered), they don't earn you SP that week.  
   * SP rewards are distributed to all share owners based on ownership percentage. For example, if you own 1% of a player's shares and they earn 100 SP, you get 1 SP.  
   * All players in your lineup contribute to your total score based on real game stats.  
5. **Progression**  
   * Earn **League XP (LXP)** by:  
     * Playing in tournaments.  
     * Buying packs or players.  
     * Winning tournaments.  
     * Holding players during weekly LXP snapshots.  
   * LXP builds up over time and qualifies you for a future **$LEAGUE token airdrop** (Token Generation Event, or TGE). It's our way to reward loyal players\!

This loop keeps things exciting—start small with free contests, build your portfolio, and climb to paid tournaments.
