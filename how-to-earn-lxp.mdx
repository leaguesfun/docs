title: 'How to Earn LXP'
description: 'You can earn LXP in four main ways: playing tournaments, buying packs, purchasing Player Shares, and holding shares. Here’s each method, explained simply with examples.'
---

### **1\. Tournament Performance**

Every time you enter a lineup in a **Premier Tournament** (paid) or **Free Tournament**, you earn LXP. The better you perform, the more you get\!

* **Base XP:** Enter any lineup \= **100 LXP**.  
* **Performance Bonuses:**  
  * Finish in the **Top 25%** of a tournament \= **\+200 LXP**.  
  * Finish in the **Top 10%** \= **\+500 LXP**.  
  * Finish in the **Top 1%** \= **\+2,000 LXP**.  
* **Example:**  
  * You enter a free tournament lineup: **100 LXP**.  
  * Your lineup scores high, landing in the Top 10%: **100 \+ 500 \= 600 LXP**.  
  * If you hit the Top 1%: **100 \+ 2,000 \= 2,100 LXP**.

### **2\. Pack Purchases**

Buying packs (Rookie to Hall of Fame) earns you LXP, scaling with the pack’s value.

* **LXP per Pack:**  
  * **Rookie Pack :** 100 LXP  
  * **Pro Pack :** 750 LXP  
  * **All-Star Pack:** 1,500 LXP  
  * **Legendary Pack :** 4,000 LXP  
  * **Hall of Fame Pack:** 10,000 LXP  
* **Example:**  
  * Buy a Rookie Pack: **250 LXP**.  
  * Buy a Hall of Fame Pack: **10,000 LXP**.  
  * Buy one of each pack: **250 \+ 750 \+ 1,500 \+ 4,000 \+ 10,000 \= 16,500 LXP**.

### **3\. Player Share Purchases**

Buying Player Shares on the **Trade Market** (our secondary marketplace with automated pricing) earns LXP based on your spending.

* **Formula:** **1 LXP per $1 spent** on shares.  
* **Example:**  
  * Spend $100 on Patrick Mahomes shares: **100 LXP**.  
  * Spend $500 on various players: **500 LXP**.

### **4\. Player Holding (Weekly Snapshot)**

Holding Player Shares earns LXP every week via a **Tuesday snapshot**. The more shares you hold, the more you earn, with bonuses for top performers.

* **Base XP:** **0.25 LXP per share per week**.  
* **Bonus Multiplier:** If a player is among the **Top 10** in their position (by fantasy points that week), their shares earn **2× LXP (0.5 LXP per share)**.  
* **Example:**  
  * You hold 1,000 shares of a player (e.g., a backup RB): **1,000 × 0.25 \= 250 LXP/week**.  
  * You hold 1,000 shares of Mahomes, who’s the Top QB: **1,000 × 0.5 \= 500 LXP/week**.  
  * Holding 1,000 shares each of 5 players (one a Top 10): **(4 × 250\) \+ 500 \= 1,500 LXP/week**.  
* **Why It Works:** Every share earns LXP, so even lesser-known players are worth holding. Stars like Mahomes give a bonus, rewarding you for chasing winners.
