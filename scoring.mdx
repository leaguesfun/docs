title: 'How Scoring Works'
description: 'Scoring is based on real player stats from games. Your lineup's total points determine your rank. It's simple: Positive actions (like touchdowns) add points; negative ones (like interceptions) subtract.'

### **Scoring Basics**

* Build a lineup and watch real games.  
* Points come from actions like yards gained, touchdowns, sacks, etc.  
* At the end, add up points from all players in your lineup—that's your **score**   
* Higher score \= better rank \= better rewards.

### **Example Lineup and Scoring**

Imagine this lineup:

* **QB:** Patrick Mahomes  
* **RB:** Christian McCaffrey  
* **WR:** Tyreek Hill  
* **TE:** Travis Kelce  
* **D/ST:** San Francisco 49ers

Game results:

* Mahomes: 300 passing yards, 3 TDs → 25 points  
* McCaffrey: 120 rushing yards, 1 TD → 18 points  
* Hill: 8 catches, 110 receiving yards, 1 TD → 29 points  
* Kelce: 6 receptions, 60 receiving yards → 12 points  
* 49ers Defense: Allows 7 points, 2 sacks → 10 points

**Total Score:** 94 points. If this beats others, you rank high\!

### **Positioning on the Leaderboard**

* All lineups are ranked by total score (highest to lowest).  
* 1st place: Highest score.  
* Your position determines your prize (if in top 20).

### **Multiple Lineups**

* Each lineup scores independently.  
* Example: Lineup A (150 points) → 2nd place (big prize). Lineup B (80 points) → 450th place (maybe no prize).
